== NOTICE ==
This map requires 1.21.6 - 1.21.7.

Bugs should be reported on the github here: https://github.com/Medacorp/Luigi-s-Mansion/issues
Please do look if it's already reported.

== Known issues ==

* A bunch of sounds are missing
** Poltergust expelling dust, vacuuming with ball held, exploding
** Blue Twirler/Blue Blaze
** Ceiling Surprise/Purple Bomber hurt/flee/complain
** Slim Bankshot
** Henry and Orville
** Clockwork Soldiers
** Furniture ambience, changing state
** Ghost Portrificationizer
* Lots of entities in rooms with mirrors cause quite some lag, I'm looking into ways to optimize it. Until I find a way to do so, you can turn mirror reflections off in the settings.
* Furniture is not the most optimized part of the map, I'm looking into ways to optimize it.
* Some instances of rapid teleportation may make client-server communication difficult. (Such as being pulled by a ghost)
** https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-197855 was made about this, but Mojang decided not to track this as a bug. A rewrite of the system was planned when Mojang was last asked.
** Until Mojang properly adresses this issue, simply change the teleportation frequency setting in the map to a less frequent value. You'll sacrifice smoothness over playability then.

== Supported languages ==
English (US) is the base language of the map, all other languages are worked on via Crowdin. (https://crowdin.com/project/medacorp-projects)
Any issues with other languages' strings should be reported there. You can also go there to help translate the map to more languages.

== Difficulty effects ==
The map supports different difficulties, which can be selected by the difficulty setting in Minecraft.
The effects are "live", while the score multiplier of the lowest difficulty ever selected in the selected mansion playthrough is used; during the intro and the lab, the score multiplier isn't updated to a lower value, only when someone is in the mansion after the intro.
The map is set to normal when downloaded.

* Peaceful = lenient pulling accuracy (anything but forward and standing still counts as pulling)
             no damage received (knockback still given)
             score x0.25
* Easy = lenient pulling accuracy (anything but forward and standing still counts as pulling)
         score x0.5
* Normal = accurate pulling accuracy (diagonal still counts as pulling)
           score x1
* Hard = strict pulling accuracy (only a slim line backwards is counted as pulling)
         short stun timer (maximum of 1 second rather than 4 seconds (10 for portrait ghosts))
         portrait ghosts need to be stunned before vacuuming
         score x2

== How to install ==
1. Launch Minecraft: Java Edition
2. Select "Options..."
3. Select "Resource Packs..."
4. Select "Open Pack folder"
- <A file explorer opens>
5. Drop the resource pack folder (named "Luigi's Mansion Resource Pack") in this folder
6. Go up one folder
7. Go to "saves"
8. Drop the world folder (named "Luigi's Mansion") in this folder
9. Enable the resource pack in the resource packs menu
10. Select to open the world
11. Be patient while it is loading everything; this is a map with a lot of functionality it needs to load in

== How to update ==
The best way to update your current save is as follows:
1. Close the world.
2. Delete the "datapacks" folder of the old world.
3. Drop the updated world onto the old world, overwriting all files it clashes with.
This will replace everything but advancements, player/entity data, statistics, scoreboard and command storage, keeping all progress you have.
If you were affected by a softlock, contact Dhranios on the Medacorp discord: https://discord.gg/Nn6wScEc88
4. Open the world.
5. Set the difficulty back to the desired value (it'll have reverted to normal).

== Installing add-ons ==
Add-ons are downloaded with their installation guides included.
Just make sure that the add-ons you install are compatible with the map version you use (and each other).
Do not rename any add-on file names (nor unzip them if they were zipped), as they may need a specific loading order, and to do this, the file name must not be changed.

== Uninstalling add-ons ==
The best way to uninstall add-ons is as follows:
1. Have every player in the world be in the underground lab. Being elsewhere in the lab or mansion may result in some broken behavior.
2. Close the world or server
3. Go to the "Luigi's Mansion" world folder
4. Go to the "datapacks" folder
5. Delete the desired add-ons. (Do NOT delete the "MEDACORP" folder, as that's the base map behavior.)

== Server properties requirements ==
