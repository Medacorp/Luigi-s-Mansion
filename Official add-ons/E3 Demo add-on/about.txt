This add-on adds a mansion that matches the E3 2001 demo of the game.

This is a separate mansion with separate save-data.
A max health counter will display in the mansion, you'll figure out why it's there when in the "area 2" hallway.
The Poltergust 500 will overheat when you vacuum for too long, keep that in mind.
New money type: Ghost Coin.
New ghost types: Ghost, Puncher, Body Slammer, Basher, Bat, Boo, Shining Ghost, Flying Fish and Mouse.
The hallways, bath room and back yard cannot be cleared.

Amiibo:
When all tasks are cleared (3DS Remake add-on), you unlock the E. Gadd amiibo, which prevents ghosts from escaping as a result of mistakes within the mansion; they can still escape if you take damage, or when they get out of reach.

== Known issues ==

* Body slammers are missing several sounds.
* Poltergust 500 misses a few sounds.
