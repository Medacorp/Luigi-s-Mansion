Q. Is the map multiplayer compatible?
A. Absolutely! The map even provides different translation strings based on player count so languages can properly pluralize them.
There is, however, an issue with rapid teleportation causing desyncs, see next question.

Q. Why is my movement not registering properly?
A. This is the problem mentioned above; rapid teleportation is the only way to pull some things off, but it comes at a cost. This cannot be fixed in the map, and is actually a minecraft bug: https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-197855
Use the Game Boy Horror to set your "Teleport Frequency" setting to a lower frequency if you're experiencing this.

Q. I'm stuck in the gallery, what do I do?
A. (No 3DS Remake) Search the angle statue, like E. Gadd hints, and his dialog will change allowing you to leave.
   (3DS Remake) Find the Game Boy Horror part, and talk to E. Gadd again, and another time for an option to leave the gallery.
   
Q. Why is only certain furniture modeled and animated, but not others?
A. Those will be converted eventually, but it takes time to model all those. The furniture that has been converted already matched one of the following criteria:
   1. It was already modeled before, just not a furniture entity
   2. It was a container before conversion
   3. It has candle flames or incense flames
   4. It is a poster
   5. A very similar piece of furniture was converted, and it was not much work to make the model for this as well.

Q. How do I scan furniture?
A. 1. Use the Game Boy Horror, and choose the Scan Furniture option.
   2. Look at the furniture you want to scan.
   3. Use the Scan Furniture again.
You cannot scan until you've gotten the Game Boy Horror part installed if you use the 3DS Remake add-on.

Q. How do you deal the most damage to a ghost?
A. Move away from the ghost quickly and rapidly; just tapping to move backwards should suffice. Don't worry about walls, you'll be kept away from them a little bit so you can still move.
Do note, that the player doesn't immediately stop moving when letting go of the controls for moving, so keep a LITTLE bit of delay for the best results.
For Boos, they always get the same damage per second, regardless of what you do, but you can stall their fleeing by stopping the vacuum for a moment, retriggering their panic animation.

Q. Why do the ghosts escape randomly from the Poltergust?
A. They don't, there's a few reasons they may have escaped: 
   1. You got (non-pulling) damage.
   2. You didn't move away from the ghost while vacuuming for a total of 10 times.
   3. You moved beyond 7 blocks of distance away from the ghost (so it is out of poltergust reach).
   4. The ghost entered a second flee state which forces an escape after 2.5 seconds.

Q. Can I disregard current data somehow?
A. Of course, just talk to E. Gadd to load your old data.

Q. How do I make grabbing ghosts let go?
A. Walk in different directions as quickly as possible. Spooky, harmful grabbing ghosts and being frozen will also decrease in duration when doing this.

Q. I can't find one of the Boos!
A. Go past every room and see if the Game Boy Horror reacts (remember, Boos can only be found in lit rooms). If no room has the Game Boy Horror reacting, make a bug report and provide the file "data/command_storage_luigis_mansion.dat" so it can be investigated.

Q. Why doesn't the option to select a choice in a dialog work?
A. Gooigi cannot speak, other players will have to react instead. If you're not using gooigi, make a bug report and provide the world folder (as a zip).

Q. Can I turn off the opening of the Game Boy Horror map when collecting a key?
A. Yes, go to the map settings (via Game Boy Horror) and use the option to change it.

Q. Is this feature missing?
A. Maybe. If you can see something is definitely missing, feel free to make a bug report.

Q. How did you do this thing?
A. The entire map and its add-ons are on github, if you wish to understand how I did something, feel free to browse through the functions. If you need further help understanding it, I could explain it if you ask. (Make a discussion topic for this, not a bug report.)

Q. Why does the vanilla training room program mention rapidly moving backwards, but the 3DS Remake one not?
A. The corresponding line in the game ("Tilt the Control Stick in the opposite direction quickly and repeatedly for the best results!") doesn't exist in a similar fashion in the 3DS Remake.

Q. Why doesn't the room clear? No ghost is appearing.
A. 1. You may need to figure out a puzzle before the ghosts appear.
   2. It may be you're standing in the exact spot the ghost wants to appear in, making you prevent its appearing.
   3. Make sure to be close to and have your back to every place at least twice, ghosts move around the room a few seconds after they vanish.
   4. A ghost may be hiding inside furniture, search it and it will appear.

Q. Why are the rooms so high? 
A. The rooms are horizontally a bit bigger than in the original game, compared to Luigi; the rooms were made taller to make it not look as stretched.
This will probably be adressed in a future map update.

Q. How do I unlock amiibos from the 3DS Remake and other add-ons?
A. The amiibos are unlocked as you clear the trophy tasks.

Q. Where's the chef ghost in the original mansion?
A. He's not added; nothing is known for sure about him, except his visuals from two grainy images. Everything else is speculation or theories. There's simply not enough known to add him.

Q. How can I catch Spooky and Miss. Petunia in the original mansion.
A. You don't, they never show their hearts.

Q. The trailer shows the player sneaking while catching a ghost, why?
A. Prior to v2.0, the rapid damage was done by switching between sneaking and standing, rather than rapidly moving back and stopping.
